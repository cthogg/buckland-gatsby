It has been a challenging time for us all since the Covid 19 outbreak. For all the downsides to the lockdown and our changed lives, gardening has provided a respite for those of us fortunate enough to have a garden and enjoying improving our green spaces. 

With all gardens from the Royal Horticultural Society and the National Trust currently closed to the public, we have had to find the beauty in our own back yards. With extra time to spend both digging - and relaxing – many “new” gardeners have seen great benefits from the nature available close to home. Both physically and mentally, gardening has been a perfect stress-reliever! Even those on the front-line of the NHS, care and other essential workers can find solace from their demanding work in the beauty of plants and the wildlife around them. 

Spring has a great sense of freshness and renewal. Let’s hope it heralds a new dawn for the gradual return to a more upbeat “new normal”. Gardening is playing its part – and always will. 

Take care.
